# Test Your Assistant in DIRTbox

The DIRTBox tab is your assistant's playground—a place where you can interactively test your chatbot just like a real user would. This is where you see your flows in action, catch issues early, and make sure everything works as expected before going live.

## What is the DIRTBox?

The DIRTBox simulates your entire assistant, letting you:
- Send messages as a user
- See your assistant's responses in real time
- Test all flows, branches, and logic
- Try out different scenarios and edge cases

It's the fastest way to spot problems, try new ideas, and make sure your assistant feels natural and helpful.

## How to Use the DIRTBox
1. Open the **DIRTBox** tab in Sequence Studio.
2. Type a message in the chat box—just like a real user.
3. Watch your assistant respond, follow the flow, and handle logic.
4. Try different paths, test variables, and make sure every branch works.
