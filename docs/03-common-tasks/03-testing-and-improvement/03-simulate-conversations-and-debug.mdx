# Simulate Conversations and Debug

Before you launch your assistant, it's crucial to simulate real conversations and debug any issues. The DIRTBox and Tests tabs make this easy.

---

## Simulate in DIRTBox

- Try out different user journeys by sending messages in the DIRTBox
- Test how your assistant handles variables, conditions, and logic branches
- Explore edge cases and unexpected inputs
- See exactly how your flows behave in real time

---

## Debug with Test Cases

- Create test cases for tricky or important scenarios
- Check that your assistant responds correctly to all types of input
- Use failed tests to pinpoint and fix bugs

---

## Why Simulate and Debug?
- Prevents surprises when your assistant goes live
- Ensures a smooth, reliable user experience
- Helps you catch and fix issues early
