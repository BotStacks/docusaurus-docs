# Integrate BotStacks with Webflow

This guide will walk you through adding the BotStacks assistant widget to your Webflow website using the custom code feature.

> **Prerequisite:** Adding custom code in Webflow requires a [Webflow Workspace plan](https://webflow.com/pricing) or higher. This feature is not available on free sites.

## 1. Copy your BotStacks widget code

Go to the **Activate** tab in your BotStacks dashboard. You'll see the code snippets you need to add to your website.

You'll need two pieces of code:
- A `<meta>` tag for the Head code section
- Two `<script>` tags for the Footer code section

### Meta tag:

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

### Script tags:

> **Note:** Be sure to copy your own `apiKey` and `botId` from the Activate tab in your BotStacks dashboard. Do not use the example values below.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://botstacks.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/webassistant.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.onload = function() {
    initBotStackAssistant({
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
      botId: "YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"
    });
  };
</script>
```

## 2. Open your Webflow project

1. Log in to your Webflow account and open the project you want to edit.
2. In the Designer, click **Settings** in the left sidebar.

## 3. Add the meta and script tags in Webflow

1. In the Settings panel, click **Custom Code**.
2. In the **Head Code** section, paste the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag.
3. In the **Footer Code** section, paste both `<script>` tags from above.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

## 4. Publish your site

1. Click **Publish** in the top-right corner of the Designer to make your changes live.
2. Visit your site and confirm the BotStacks widget appears.
