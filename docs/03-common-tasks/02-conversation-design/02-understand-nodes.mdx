# Understand Nodes: The Building Blocks of Flows

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of every flow in Sequence Studio. Each node performs a specific function—like sending a message, waiting for a reply, or making a decision—and by connecting them, you create powerful, interactive conversations.

> **If you're new to flows, check out [Build Flows](build-flows) first for a step-by-step guide to creating and connecting nodes. This page dives deeper into what each node does and how to use them. For advanced logic, see [Conditions & Logic](conditions-logic) next.**

## What Are Nodes?

A node represents a single step or action in your assistant's flow. By combining different node types, you can:
- Send messages
- Collect information
- Make decisions
- Call APIs
- And much more

## Node Types and When to Use Them

### **Text Block Node**
- **Purpose:** Outputs a static text block.
- **When to use:** Any time you want to explicitly write a certain message to the user.
- **Example:** "Welcome to PizzaBot! How can I help you today?"

### **AI Model Node**
- **Purpose:** Outputs a text block generated by an AI model.
- **When to use:** Any time you want your assistant to say something—greetings, instructions, confirmations, etc.

### **Send Message Node**
- **Purpose:** Sends a message to the user consisting of the output of the previous node.
- **When to use:** Directly after a Text Block, AI Model, or other node to send a message consisting of its output.

### **Wait for Reply Node**
- **Purpose:** Pauses the flow and waits for the user to respond.
- **When to use:** Whenever you need input from the user before continuing.
- **Example:** "What would you like to order?"

### **Set Value Node**
- **Purpose:** Stores information (like user input) in a variable.
- **When to use:** When you want to remember something the user said, or set a value for later use.
- **Example:** Save the user's name or choice.

### **Condition Node**
- **Purpose:** Branches the flow based on variable values (if/else logic).
- **When to use:** When you want to take different actions depending on what the user said or did.
- **Example:** If the user is a new customer, show onboarding; otherwise, skip ahead.
- *See [Conditions & Logic](conditions-logic) for advanced branching techniques.*

### **Intent Classify Node**
- **Purpose:** Uses AI to figure out what the user wants (their "intent") and route the conversation accordingly.
- **When to use:** For open-ended questions, or when you want your assistant to handle multiple topics flexibly.
- **Example:** Route to "Order Pizza", "Check Order Status", or "Ask a Question" based on what the user types.
- *See [Conditions & Logic](conditions-logic) for more on intents and smart branching.*

### **Other Useful Nodes**
- **Collect Info:** Sends a form to the user to collect information like phone number, name, date, etc.
- **Code Snippet:** Run a snippet of Javascript code.
- **API Call Node:** Connect to external services or databases.
- **End Node:** Mark the end of a flow or conversation.
- **Front:** Integrate with Front live chat
- **Crisp:** Integrate with Crisp live chat

## How to Choose the Right Node

| **If you want to...**                  | **Use this node**      |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Say something to the user              | Text Block             |
| Say something to the user              | AI Model               |
| Wait for user input                    | Wait for Reply         |
| Remember what the user said            | Set Value              |
| Take different paths based on data     | Condition              |
| Route by user intent (AI)              | Intent                 |
| Collect information from the user      | Collect Info           |
| Run a snippet of code                  | Code Snippet           |
| Call an external API                   | API Call               |
| End the conversation                   | End                    |
| Integrate with Front                   | Front                  |
| Integrate with Crisp                   | Crisp                  |

## Tips for Using Nodes Effectively
- **Keep flows simple:** Start with a few nodes, then add complexity as needed.
- **Use variables:** Store important info for use later in the flow.
- **Test each branch:** Try different user inputs to make sure all paths work.
- **Label/comment:** Use node labels or comments to keep your flows organized.

With a solid understanding of nodes, you can build powerful, flexible flows that handle any conversation scenario. Next, try building your own flow or explore advanced logic in [Conditions & Logic](conditions-logic).
