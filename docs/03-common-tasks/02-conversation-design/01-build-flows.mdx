# Build Flows with Sequence Studio

## What is a Conversation Flow?
A conversation flow is the step-by-step path your AI assistant follows to interact with users. It's like a map: each step (or "node") represents an action, question, or response, and the connections between them define how the conversation moves forward.

Flows let you design everything from simple Q&A bots to complex, multi-step assistants that can remember information, branch based on user input, and connect to external services.

## How Flows Work in Sequence Studio
Sequence Studio is a visual builder. You drag and drop nodes onto a canvas, connect them, and configure their behavior. The flow starts at a **Start** node and moves from node to node based on your design.

## Nodes: The Building Blocks
Nodes are the core steps in your flow. Each node does something specific—like sending a message, waiting for user input, calling an API, or making a decision.

### Common Node Types
- **Start:** Where every flow begins. Triggers when a user starts a chat or sends a message.
- **AI Model:** Uses an AI model (like GPT-4) to generate a response.
- **Wait for Reply:** Waits for user input before continuing.
- **Text:** Outputs a specific message or value.
- **Send Message:** Sends a message to the user in the chat.
- **Set Value:** Stores or updates a variable.
- **Condition:** Branches the flow based on logic (e.g., if/else).
- **API Call:** Calls an external service and uses the result.
- **Intent:** Routes based on user intent.
- **End:** Ends the conversation.

## Connections: How Nodes Talk to Each Other
Connections are the arrows that link nodes. They define the order of operations and how data moves. You create a connection by dragging from a node's output to another node's input.

- Some nodes (like Condition or Intent Classify) have multiple outputs for different branches.
- You can loop connections to create repeating flows (e.g., keep listening for user input).

## Building Your First Assistant: Step-by-Step
1. **Open Sequence Studio** from your assistant's dashboard.
3. **Add an AI Model Node** from the Start node to generate AI responses.
5. **Add a Send Message Node** from the AI Model node to send the AI's message to the user.
4. **Add a Wait for Reply Node** from the Send Message node to wait for user input.
6. **Complete the Loop** by connecting the Wait for Reply back to the AI Model node.
7. **Configure Node Settings:** Click a node to set its options (e.g., choose a model for the AI Model node, like GPT-4o).
8. **Test Your Flow:** Use the preview or run button to see your assistant in action.

## How Data Moves Through a Flow
- When a user sends a message, the Start node is triggered.
- Data (like the user's message) is passed from node to node via connections.
- Variables can be set and used throughout the flow for memory and logic.

**Example:**
- User says: "What's the weather?"
- Start node passes the message to AI Model node.
- AI Model node generates a response using the message and any relevant variables.
- Send Message node sends the answer to the user.
- Wait for Reply node waits for the next user input, and the loop continues.

## Tips for Designing Great Flows
- Start simple: get a basic loop working, then add complexity.
- Use clear, descriptive names for nodes and variables.
- Test often—preview your flow after each change.
- Use variables to remember important info (like names, preferences, etc.).
- Use Condition and Intent nodes to make your assistant smarter and more dynamic.
- Keep flows organized—use comments or labels if available.

## What's Next?
Now that you understand flows, dive deeper into each node type and learn how to use advanced features like branching, memory, and API calls to build powerful assistants.
