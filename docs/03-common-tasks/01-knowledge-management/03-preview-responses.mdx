# Preview Assistant Responses with BrainVault

The **Preview** feature in Brain Vault lets you instantly test how your assistant will answer questions using your uploaded knowledge sourcesâ€”before you publish or update your assistant.

This is the fastest way to check if your data is being used correctly, and to fine-tune your model settings for the best possible answers.

## How to Preview Responses

1. Open the **Brain Vault** pane in Sequence Studio.
2. Click the <strong>Preview</strong> button in the top right corner.

(Optional) Click the <strong>Settings</strong> button to adjust:
   - **Model** (e.g., GPT-4o mini, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
   - **Temperature** (controls creativity vs. accuracy)
   - **Max Tokens** (limits response length)
   - **Top P** (controls diversity of responses)
   - **System Prompt** (set the assistant's persona or instructions)

## Tips for Best Results

- **Test a variety of questions** to make sure your assistant can find and use the right knowledge source.
- If the answer isn't accurate, try:
  - Adding or updating your knowledge sources
  - Adjusting the system prompt for more specific instructions
  - Tweaking model settings (lower temperature for more factual answers)
- Use the preview as a quick feedback loop before deploying changes to your live assistant.
