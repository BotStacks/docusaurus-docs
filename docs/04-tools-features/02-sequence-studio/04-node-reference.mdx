# Node Reference: Sequence Studio

This page documents all core node types available in Sequence Studio. Each node is a modular building block for your conversational flows.

---

## Start Node
**Slug:** start-0

**Purpose:** Entry point for every flow. Triggers when a user starts a chat or sends a message.

- **Paths:**
  - On Trigger: When the chat/widget opens (for greetings, onboarding, etc.)
  - On Message: When the user sends the first message (for bots that wait for input)
- **Usage:** Always the first node in any flow.
- **Tips:** Use On Trigger for proactive greetings; On Message for bots that wait for user input.

---

## AI Model Node
**Slug:** llm-index

**Purpose:** Uses an AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) to generate a response.

- **Options:**
  - Model selection (choose from available LLMs)
  - Use Brain Vault (enable knowledge retrieval)
  - Use chat history (include previous messages for context)
  - System prompt (instructions for the model)
  - User prompt (dynamic input, can reference other nodes)
  - Temperature (creativity)
  - Max tokens (response length)
  - Top-p (diversity)
- **Usage:** Place after Start or Wait for Reply to generate dynamic, context-aware responses.
- **Tips:** Reference variables or previous node outputs in prompts for personalized answers.

---

## Text Block Node
**Slug:** text-index

**Purpose:** Outputs a static text block (plain message or value).

- **Usage:** Use for greetings, instructions, or canned responses.
- **Options:**
  - Text content (can reference variables or node outputs)
- **Tips:** Use for fixed messages or to insert static values into the flow.

---

## Send Message Node
**Slug:** airesponse-index

**Purpose:** Sends a message to the user, using the output of the previous node.

- **Features:**
  - Can display canned responses as buttons (quick replies)
- **Usage:** Place after Text Block, AI Model, or other nodes to deliver messages.
- **Tips:** Use canned responses to guide user choices and simplify branching.

---

## Wait for Reply Node
**Slug:** listen-index

**Purpose:** Pauses the flow and waits for user input before continuing.

- **Usage:** Use whenever you need input from the user before proceeding.
- **Tips:** Combine with AI Model and looping for ongoing conversations.

---

## Set Value Node
**Slug:** set-index

**Purpose:** Stores or updates a variable (e.g., user input, state).

- **Options:**
  - Set: Replace value
  - Append: Add to existing value
- **Usage:** Remember names, choices, or other data for use later in the flow.
- **Tips:** Use clear variable names and update variables as needed for logic and personalization.

---

## Condition Node
**Slug:** condition-index

**Purpose:** Branches the flow based on variable values (if/else logic).

- **Features:**
  - Multiple conditions (AND/OR logic)
  - Otherwise path (fallback)
- **Usage:**
  - Add one or more conditions to check variables or values
  - Each condition creates a separate output path
  - Use Otherwise for fallback/default behavior
- **Tips:** Use for logic branching, personalization, and error handling.
- **Related:** See [Conditions & Logic](../../common-tasks/conversation-design/conditions-logic) for a practical guide to using conditions in flows.

---

## Intent Classify Node
**Slug:** classify-index

**Purpose:** Uses AI to classify user intent and route the conversation accordingly.

- **Features:**
  - Define multiple intents with example utterances
  - Each intent creates a separate output path
- **Usage:**
  - Add intents in the Intents panel
  - Use for open-ended input, topic routing, or multi-purpose bots
- **Tips:** Provide diverse, realistic examples for each intent to improve accuracy.
- **Related:**
  - See [Understand Nodes](../../common-tasks/conversation-design/understand-nodes) for an introduction to intents.
  - See [Conditions & Logic](../../common-tasks/conversation-design/conditions-logic) for more on using intents and conditions in flows.

---

## API Call Node
**Slug:** api-index

**Purpose:** Connects to external REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).

- **Options:**
  - Request method and URL (can use variables/interpolation)
  - Custom headers
  - Body (JSON, for POST/PUT/PATCH)
- **Features:**
  - Success/Error routing based on HTTP response
- **Usage:**
  - Integrate with third-party services, databases, or business logic
  - Reference API results in downstream nodes
- **Tips:** Use variables to build dynamic requests; handle errors with fallback paths.

---

## JavaScript Node
**Slug:** code-index

**Purpose:** Runs custom JavaScript code for advanced logic or calculations.

- **Features:**
  - Access and update variables via the `variables` object
  - Use `saveVariables` to set new values
  - Custom routing via return statements
  - Error/Fallback handling
- **Usage:**
  - Perform calculations, data transformation, or custom integrations
  - Route to different paths based on code logic
- **Tips:** Handle all possible errors; use return statements to control flow.

---

## End Node
**Slug:** end-index

**Purpose:** Marks the end of a flow. Resets conversation state for the user.

- **Usage:** Use to end conversations, clear memory, or reset the assistant.
- **Tips:** Place at the end of flows or after error/exit conditions.

---

## Advanced/Other Nodes
- **Collect Info Node:** (slug: userdatacapture-index) Sends a form to collect structured data (e.g., phone, email, date). *(See roadmap or ask support if not visible)*
- **Front/Crisp Nodes:** (slug: front-index/crips-index) Integrate with Front or Crisp live chat platforms.

## Node Usage Patterns & Tips
- Start with a simple loop (Start → AI Model → Send Message → Wait for Reply → loop)
- Use variables and Set Value nodes to remember important info
- Use Condition and Intent nodes for advanced logic and branching
- Test each branch and scenario in preview mode
- Keep flows organized with comments, labels, and logical layout 
- The slug index is zero-based and increments sequentially for each additional node of the same type
