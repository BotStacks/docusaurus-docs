# Panels in Sequence Studio

Sequence Studio includes several panels that provide access to key configuration and management features. Each panel is essential for building robust, flexible, and maintainable conversational assistants.

## Variables Panel
- **Purpose:** Define, view, and manage variables used throughout your flows.
- **Usage:**
  - Store user input, state, and other data for use in logic and responses.
  - Add, edit, or remove variables as your flow evolves.
  - Reference variables in node prompts, conditions, and API calls.
- **Tips:**
  - Use clear, descriptive names for variables.
  - Regularly review and clean up unused variables.
- **Related:** See [Conditions & Logic](../../common-tasks/conversation-design/conditions-logic) for advanced variable usage.

## Brain Vault Panel
- **Purpose:** Manage your assistant's knowledge sources.
- **Usage:**
  - Add, organize, and preview documents, URLs, and text that the AI can reference for accurate answers.
  - Test retrieval and tune knowledge settings.
- **Tips:**
  - Keep sources focused and well-titled for best retrieval.
  - Use the preview feature to test knowledge before deploying.
- **Related:** See [Brain Vault Reference](../brain-vault) for full details.

## Revisions Panel
- **Purpose:** Improve your assistant's accuracy by providing sample questions, incorrect responses, explanations of why the answer was wrong, and (optionally) a correct response. This helps the model learn and refine its answers over time.
- **Usage:**
  - Enter a sample user question.
  - Record the assistant's incorrect response.
  - Explain why the response was wrong.
  - (Optional) Provide the correct response for reference.
  - Use the preview button to test how the assistant would answer now.
- **Tips:**
  - Use real-world examples from transcripts or user feedback.
  - Regularly update with new edge cases or misunderstood questions.
- **Related:** See [Preview & Test](../../common-tasks/knowledge-management/preview-responses) for more on testing and improving answers.

## Intents Panel
- **Purpose:** Define and manage user intents and example utterances for use with the Intent Classify node.
- **Usage:**
  - Organize how your assistant recognizes and routes open-ended user input.
  - Add, edit, or remove intents and provide example phrases for each.
- **Tips:**
  - Provide diverse, realistic examples for each intent to improve classification.
  - Regularly review and refine intents as your assistant grows.
- **Related:**
  - See [Understand Nodes](../../common-tasks/conversation-design/understand-nodes) for an introduction to intents.
  - See [Conditions & Logic](../../common-tasks/conversation-design/conditions-logic) for more on using intents and conditions in flows.
