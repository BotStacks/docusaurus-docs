# Design Features in Sequence Studio

Sequence Studio provides a robust set of visual tools for building and testing conversational flows:

## Drag-and-Drop Canvas
- Arrange and connect nodes visually to map out your conversation logic.
- Zoom and pan to navigate large or complex flows.
- Use the minimap for quick navigation.

## Node Settings Panel
- Click any node to open its settings panel.
- Configure prompts, variables, API details, and more.
- See context-sensitive options based on node type.

## Preview & Run
- Test your flow in real time using the built-in preview.
- Simulate user input and see how your assistant responds.
- Debug logic, check variable values, and iterate quickly.

## Looping
- Connect nodes to create repeating flows (e.g., chat loops that keep the conversation going).
- Use Wait for Reply and AI Model nodes in a loop for ongoing conversations.

## Branching
- Use Condition and Intent nodes to create smart, dynamic flows that adapt to user input.
- Branch based on variables, user choices, or AI-classified intent.

## Connections
- Drag from a node's output to another node's input to define the order and logic of execution.
- Use multiple outputs for branching nodes (e.g., Condition, Intent Classify).

## Practical Tips
- Use clear, descriptive names for nodes and variables.
- Test each branch and scenario in preview mode.
- Keep flows organized with comments, labels, and logical layout.
- Start simple, then add complexity as needed.
