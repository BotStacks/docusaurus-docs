# Best Practices for Sequence Studio

Follow these best practices to build robust, maintainable, and effective conversational flows in Sequence Studio.

## Flow Design
- **Start simple:** Get a basic loop working before adding complexity.
- **Modularize:** Break large flows into smaller, reusable sub-flows where possible.
- **Visual clarity:** Lay out nodes logically and use comments/labels to keep flows organized.

## Naming Conventions
- **Nodes:** Use descriptive names for each node (e.g., `Ask Name`, `Check Age`).
- **Variables:** Use clear, consistent variable names (e.g., `user_name`, `order_status`).
- **Intents:** Name intents based on user goals (e.g., `OrderPizza`, `GetSupport`).

## Variable Management
- **Define up front:** List all variables you'll need before building complex logic.
- **Clean up:** Remove unused variables regularly.
- **Scope:** Use variables for data you need to reference across multiple nodes.

## Testing & Debugging
- **Preview often:** Use the built-in preview to test each branch and scenario.
- **DIRTbox:** Simulate real conversations and edge cases.
- **Logs & transcripts:** Review logs to spot issues and improve flows.
- **Automated tests:** Create test cases for critical paths (if available).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preview your flow">Use the built-in preview to check each branch and scenario before moving on.</Step>
  <Step title="Test in DIRTbox">Simulate real conversations and edge cases in the DIRTbox to catch unexpected issues.</Step>
  <Step title="Review logs">Check transcripts and logs to spot issues and improve your flows based on real data.</Step>
</Steps>

## Collaboration
- **Revision history:** Use the Revisions tab to track changes and roll back if needed.
- **Notes:** Add comments or revision notes for team context.
- **Consistent style:** Agree on naming and design conventions with your team.

## Scaling Flows
- **Reuse patterns:** Copy/paste or template common logic (e.g., error handling, data collection).
- **Branching:** Use Condition and Intent nodes for smart, scalable branching.
- **Performance:** Keep flows efficientâ€”avoid unnecessary loops or redundant nodes.
