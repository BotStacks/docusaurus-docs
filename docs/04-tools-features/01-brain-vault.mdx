# Brain Vault: Full Feature Reference

## Overview

**Brain Vault** is the knowledge management engine of BotStacks. It acts as your assistant's memory, providing live, context-rich information to LLMs and conversation flows. Brain Vault is designed for accuracy, security, and scaleâ€”whether you're building a simple FAQ bot or a complex enterprise assistant.

## Supported Knowledge Source Types

Brain Vault supports a variety of source types, each called a **Knowledge Source**:

- **Single URL**: Ingests the content of a public web page (e.g., pricing, docs, release notes).
- **Bulk URLs**: Add multiple URLs at once (newline-separated list). Ideal for catalogs, blogs, or documentation sets.
- **Site Crawl**: Crawl a root URL and automatically ingest all reachable internal pages.
- **File Upload**: Upload PDF, DOCX, TXT, or Markdown files (up to 50 MB each).
- **Text Snippet**: Paste or type plain text directly (for FAQs, policies, or one-off info).

> **File Size Limit:** 50 MB per upload.

## Storage and Plan-Based Limits

The number of knowledge sources you can store depends on your subscription plan:

| Plan                | Knowledge Sources |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Starter             | 50               |
| Pro                 | 250              |
| Pro+                | 500              |
| Agency/Enterprise   | 3,000            |

- **All plans**: Each source is indexed and available for live retrieval.
- **Upgrade**: Increase limits by upgrading your plan.

## Organization & Prioritization

Efficient knowledge management is critical for high-quality answers. Brain Vault treats all sources equally in retrieval, so:

- **Use Descriptive Titles**: Name each source clearly (e.g., `Refund-Policy-2025`).
- **Keep Sources Bite-Sized**: Split large files (manuals, PDFs) into smaller sections for more precise retrieval and lower token costs.
- **Remove Stale Content**: Delete outdated docs and re-upload new versions to avoid conflicting answers.
- **Preview Early & Often**: Use the Preview feature to test retrieval and fix issues before deploying.

**Bulk Import:**
- Use Bulk URLs or Site Crawl for large-scale imports.

## Integration with LLM Nodes

Brain Vault is designed to work seamlessly with LLM (Large Language Model) nodes in Sequence Studio:

- **Enable Brain Vault**: In the LLM node, toggle "Use Brain Vault" to allow the model to retrieve from your knowledge sources.
- **Retrieval**: The LLM node will search the Vault and inject relevant snippets into the prompt for accurate, context-aware answers.
- **Settings**: Combine with other LLM node options (model selection, system/user prompt, temperature, max tokens, top-p, chat history) for fine-tuned control.

## Retrieval, Search, and Ranking

- **Vector Search**: Brain Vault uses vector embeddings to match user queries to the most relevant knowledge snippets.
- **Ranking**: All sources are ranked by semantic similarity; quality and clarity of each source directly impact answer quality.
- **No Manual Prioritization**: All sources are treated equally; use organization best practices for optimal results.

---

## Preview & Testing Features

- **Preview Panel**: Instantly test how your assistant will answer questions using your current Brain Vault.
- **Settings in Preview**:
  - Model (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
  - Temperature (creativity vs. accuracy)
  - Max Tokens (response length)
  - Top P (diversity)
  - System Prompt (persona/instructions)
- **Feedback Loop**: Use Preview to quickly iterate on your Vault and settings before publishing.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Test a Variety of Questions**: Ensure your assistant can find and use the right source for different phrasings.
- **Refine Data**: If answers are off, add more precise data or split large sources.
- **System Prompt Tuning**: Adjust the system prompt for more specific or on-brand answers.
- **Regular Clean-Up**: Remove or update sources as your business or documentation changes.
