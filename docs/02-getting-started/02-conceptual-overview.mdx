# How BotStacks Works: Conceptual Overview

BotStacks is a no-code platform that lets you build, train, and deploy AI assistants for your website, product, or business—without needing a dev team. This page gives you a high-level look at how BotStacks brings together knowledge, conversation design, and integrations to create powerful, memorable AI experiences.

## The BotStacks Architecture

BotStacks is built around three core pillars:

1. **Knowledge Management (Brain Vault)**  
   Add, organize, and update your assistant's knowledge base. Upload documents, crawl websites, or paste text. Each piece of data becomes a "Knowledge Source" your assistant can reference live.

2. **Conversation Design (Sequence Studio)**  
   Use a visual flow builder to map out how your assistant interacts with users. Drag in nodes for LLMs, conditions, API calls, and more. Connect them to create dynamic, multi-step conversations.

3. **Omnichannel Deployment & Integrations**  
   Launch your assistant on your website, in messaging apps, or via API. Customize the look and feel, and connect to the tools you already use.

## How It All Comes Together

1. **Add Knowledge**  
   Start by stocking your Brain Vault with FAQs, docs, policies, or any info your assistant needs.

2. **Design Flows**  
   In Sequence Studio, create the logic for how your assistant greets users, answers questions, and handles complex tasks. Use nodes for LLMs, conditions, variables, and more.

3. **Test & Refine**  
   Use the built-in DIRTbox to preview and debug your assistant before going live.

4. **Deploy Anywhere**  
   Publish your assistant to your website with a simple widget, or connect to Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, and more.
