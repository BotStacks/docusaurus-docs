## BotStack

A BotStack represents one assistant. When you visit the dashboard, you'll find a list of all your BotStacks.

### Two Ways to Create a BotStack:

1. **Create a new BotStack from scratch.**  
2. **Use a template.**

This guide walks you through creating a new BotStack from scratch. If you'd prefer to start with a template, simply select one from the dashboard.

### Creating a BotStack from Scratch

To create a new BotStack:

1. In your dashboard, click the **Create new BotStack** button in the top row, just above your list of BotStacks.

2. When you create a new BotStack, a pop-up window will prompt you to enter a name for your BotStack. You can change this name later without affecting your assistant in any way; it's just for your reference on the dashboard.

3. After creating the BotStack, you'll be taken to the **Sequence Studio**, where you can start building your AI assistant.
