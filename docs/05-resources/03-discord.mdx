Looking for support, have a feature request, or want to connect with other BotStacks builders?

Our Discord is the best place to:
- Ask questions and get help from both the BotStacks team and other developers
- Share your projects, ideas, and feedback
- Request features or report bugs directly to the team
- Connect with others working on similar problems

We welcome everyone, whether you’re just getting started or building advanced automations.

If you have specific needs or ideas that aren’t covered in the docs, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/5kwyQCz3zZ) and tell us about your stack or use-case! We’re always excited to hear what you’re building.
